### Project Description
The app developed under this project manually inputted into the database, then it stores this information to notify users a couple of days before the products' expiration. The idea of this application is to help decrease waste, maintain order, and provide the utmost convenience to its users.

### The Problem statement
The expiry of most packaged food products and other commodities remains unnoticed, resulting in wastage, loss of money, and health hazards. Lack of tracking, disorganization, and misinterpretation of expiry labels contribute to this issue and therefore necessitate an efficient expiry management solution.

### The Solution
The app helps in giving the notification and helps the buyers to know when the food/product is getting expired and use it without wastage.

This Product Expiry Tracker app is designed to help users keep track of the expiry dates of their products, and it addresses a common problem of products expiring and going to waste.  Here's why this app is important and the benefits it offers:

Importance and Benefits:

-Reduces Waste:  The primary reason this app is important is that it helps reduce product waste.  By providing timely reminders about expiring products, users are more 
 likely to use them before they expire, saving money and reducing the environmental impact of throwing away unused goods. ¬† 

-Saves Money: Expired products often end up being thrown away, which is essentially throwing money in the bin. By using this app, users can avoid wasting money on products 
 they don't end up using. ¬† 

Promotes Health and Safety: Consuming expired products can pose health risks. This app helps users avoid potential health issues by reminding them to use products before 
 they become unsafe. ¬† 

Customizable and User-Friendly: The app is designed to be easy to use, with a simple interface for adding products and clear notifications about expiring items.  The ability to customize notification settings (like the number of notifications and the time frame) makes it adaptable to individual needs. ¬† 

Accessible: As a web application, it's accessible on various devices (phones, tablets, computers) with internet access, making it convenient to use.

In today's world, where sustainability and minimizing waste are becoming increasingly important, this app offers a practical solution to a common problem faced by many individuals and households.
