### Project Description
The app developed under this project manually inputted into the database, then it stores this information to notify users a couple of days before the products' expiration. The idea of this application is to help decrease waste, maintain order, and provide the utmost convenience to its users.

### The Problem statement
The expiry of most packaged food products and other commodities remains unnoticed, resulting in wastage, loss of money, and health hazards. Lack of tracking, disorganization, and misinterpretation of expiry labels contribute to this issue and therefore necessitate an efficient expiry management solution.

### The Solution
The app helps in giving the notification and helps the buyers to know when the food/product is getting expired and use it without wastage.
